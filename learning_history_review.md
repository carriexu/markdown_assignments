##Reviewing My Learning History##

**What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**
I get distracted easily, therefore sitting through hours of coding is sometimes challenging because my mind wanders from time to time.

**How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**
I have a pair of really good headphones for when I need to work alone.

**What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?**
Reviewing what I learned every night and reviewing again the next morning helps me retain information.

**Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)**
We could try to learn the more difficult concepts in the morning instead of the afternoon. Brain is likely to be more active. After lunch it is so easy to slip into a food coma.

**What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**
I fear that I might not get enough exercise.

**Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**
It is a valid fear and it is something I will work on to try to do at least some exercise, I believe some exercise is good for retaining knowledge.
